# Firearms

Rules from Gunslinger class from Matt Mercer:

**Reload** The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one hand free to reload a firearm.

**Misfire** Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon's Misfire score, the weapn misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try to repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a succesful Tinker's Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon's misfire score by 1.

## Crafting

A firearm can be crafted by spending time with a shop and using Tinker's Tools.

**Masterwork** When crafting an item, make a Tinker's Tools check after completing the time required to craft it. On a success, the item is *masterwork* quality. A *masterwork* firearm reduces the Misfire chance by 1.

**Time** Time required is based on 1 week per 50gp cost of the firearm. A day's crafting can be done as part of a long rest. This can be reduced by multiple people (proficient in Tinker's Tools) working on the item simultaneously. Time can also be reduced by finding ready-made components such as springs, tubes, and bearings at the DM's discretion.

**Ammo** When crafting ammo, you craft batches at a time based on the ammo type. Each firearm requires different types of ammo, except the Pistol and the Pepperbox which share ammo types. When you craft ammo, subtract half the market value of the ammo crafted from the total GP worth of raw materials you are carrying. For example, if you are crafting Pistol ammo at 4gp per batch, you subtract 2gp work of black powder, brass, and lead from your supplies.

An artificer can magically create enough black powder for 1 batch of basic ammo per day during a long rest.
